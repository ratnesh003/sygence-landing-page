    "Sygence was founded to address one of the most critical gaps in modern global business: the inability of legacy systems to orchestrate complex, multi-enterprise networks in real time. As supply chains expanded across continents, functions and partners, traditional tools like ERPs, spreadsheets and APIs — designed for internal optimization — couldn’t keep pace with the volatility, visibility gaps and coordination challenges of the network economy. When disruptions struck, there was no unified view, resulting in faulty coordination and escalated costs.",
    "Sygence’s mission is to build NexNet - a network-native, AI-augmented platform for multi-enterprise orchestration that transforms disconnected operations into a synchronized collaboration grid. Instead of replacing legacy infrastructure, NexNet layers over existing systems as the intelligence and coordination layer, feeding real-time internal and network-wide data back into enterprise platforms and compounding their value.
